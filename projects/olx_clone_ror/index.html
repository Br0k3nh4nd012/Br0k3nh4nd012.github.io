Why This Project Is Cool: Dynamic Ad Listings: Create, browse, update, or delete ads with ease. Got stuff to sell? Post it! Looking for deals? Browse the listings without any hiccups. Secure User Authentication: Integrated Devise for simple and secure user sign-ups, logins, and password resets, keeping your account and data safe while you&rsquo;re exploring and posting. PostgreSQL Power: Using PostgreSQL as the database ensures smooth handling of all data, even as the platform grows with new ads and users. Admin Panel Awesomeness: With ActiveAdmin, admins can easily manage users, ads, and flagged content through a simple and powerful dashboard. Soft Deletion with Paranoia: Accidental deletions? No problem! Paranoia allows you to recover deleted posts and recordsâ€”peace of mind for everyone. Whatâ€™s Under The Hood? Rails 6 to power the back end, delivering fast, stable, and scalable code Puma web server to handle multiple requests and keep everything running smoothly PostgreSQL handles all the storage, ensuring the app remains efficient and scalable. How It Works: User Authentication: Users sign up or log in using Devise and can create and manage their ads. Admin Dashboard: ActiveAdmin lets administrators easily control ads, monitor flagged content, and manage user data. Ad Management: Users can manage their ads from posting new items to updating or deleting themâ€”all stored and handled via PostgreSQL. Fun Factor? ðŸ’¥ This project is an excellent example of combining functionality with creativity, making something thatâ€™s not just useful, but also fun to build! From the database setup to the sleek user interface, it was an awesome journey of turning a simple idea into a fully functioning, production-ready application.
