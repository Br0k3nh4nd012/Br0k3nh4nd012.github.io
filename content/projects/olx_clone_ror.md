title = 'OLX Clone using Ruby on Rails'
+++

Ever wondered how platforms like **OLX** handle ad posts, user interaction, and product management? Well, I built a clone of it using **Ruby on Rails 6**, packed with features like secure user authentication, ad posting, and smooth listing management.

ðŸ“‚ðŸ“‘  Explore the code at [**Githu Repo**](https://github.com/Br0k3nh4nd012/sampleOLX--ROR) ðŸ”—


## Why This Project Is Cool:

- **Dynamic Ad Listings**: Create, browse, update, or delete ads with ease. Got stuff to sell? Post it! Looking for deals? Browse the listings without any hiccups.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Integrated **Devise** for simple and secure user sign-ups, logins, and password resets, keeping your account and data safe while you're exploring and posting.
- **PostgreSQL Power**: Using **PostgreSQL** as the database ensures smooth handling of all data, even as the platform grows with new ads and users.
- **Admin Panel Awesomeness**: With **ActiveAdmin**, admins can easily manage users, ads, and flagged content through a simple and powerful dashboard.
- **Soft Deletion with Paranoia**: Accidental deletions? No problem! **Paranoia** allows you to recover deleted posts and recordsâ€”peace of mind for everyone.

## Whatâ€™s Under The Hood?

- **Rails 6** to power the back end, delivering fast, stable, and scalable code
- **Puma** web server to handle multiple requests and keep everything running smoothly
- **PostgreSQL** handles all the storage, ensuring the app remains efficient and scalable.

## How It Works:

1. **User Authentication**: Users sign up or log in using **Devise** and can create and manage their ads.
2. **Admin Dashboard**: **ActiveAdmin** lets administrators easily control ads, monitor flagged content, and manage user data.
3. **Ad Management**: Users can manage their ads from posting new items to updating or deleting themâ€”all stored and handled via **PostgreSQL**.

## Fun Factor? ðŸ’¥

This project is an excellent example of combining functionality with creativity, making something thatâ€™s not just useful, but also fun to build! From the database setup to the sleek user interface, it was an awesome journey of turning a simple idea into a fully functioning, production-ready application.
