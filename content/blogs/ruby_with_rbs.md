+++

Ruby has always been a language known for its flexibility and ease of use. But over the years, its dynamic nature has made type safety a challenging issue for developers. While Ruby isn’t a statically typed language like Java or C#, developers working on large, complex systems often need ways to reduce bugs, enhance readability, and improve the development workflow. Enter **Ruby RBS**.

In this blog, we’ll delve into **Ruby RBS**, what it is, how it helps with static typing in Ruby, and how you can integrate it into your Ruby projects.

## What is RBS?

RBS (Ruby Signature Files) is an experimental feature introduced in Ruby 3 that provides **static typing** capabilities to Ruby. Ruby has traditionally been dynamically typed, meaning you don't specify types for variables or method arguments. This flexibility can sometimes lead to unintended errors, especially as projects grow in size.

RBS works as a separate type description file that allows developers to specify the types of methods, classes, and modules **without altering the main Ruby code**. The `.rbs` files do not affect the runtime behavior of the code, but they provide important metadata for tools like **Type Checkers** (e.g., **Steep**, **Sorbet**), IDEs, and other static analysis tools.

## How Does RBS Work?

Let’s explore the basics of an RBS file.

### Defining Classes and Methods in RBS

An RBS file represents types separately from your Ruby source code. These files include class and module definitions, method signatures, type aliases, and more.

For example, here’s how you would describe a simple Ruby class `Person`:

#### Ruby Class:
```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def greet
    "Hello, my name is #{@name}, and I am #{@age} years old."
  end
end
```

#### Corresponding RBS:
```rbs
class Person
  def initialize: (String, Integer) -> void
  def greet: () -> String
end
```

#### In the **RBS** file:

- `def initialize: (String, Integer) -> void` defines the type signature for the `initialize` method. It takes a `String` (for the name) and an `Integer` (for the age) and returns nothing (`void`).
- `def greet: () -> String` defines the type of the greet method. It takes no arguments and returns a `String`.

## How to Use RBS in Your Project
- Add RBS Files Create `.rbs` files in your project. By convention, they are stored in the `sigs` directory or at the root level of your project.

- Type Check Your Code Tools like Steep can be used to type-check Ruby files with associated `.rbs` files:
  - Install `Steep` using gem install steep
  - Run `steep check` to type-check your project.
- **Integration with Editors** Editors like `VSCode` or `RubyMine` have plugins or built-in features to help parse and analyze `.rbs` files. Once set up, they provide intellisense and highlight type errors within your IDE.

- **Gradual Typing** You can gradually introduce RBS files to your Ruby codebase. Start by writing method signatures for core classes and methods, then expand as needed. It's possible to opt into stricter type checking over time.

## Challenges and Considerations
- **No Runtime Validation:** RBS files are only for type checking and do not alter how Ruby runs at runtime. This means they won't catch dynamic issues (like runtime `NilClass` errors) during execution.
- **Complexity with Legacy Code:** Existing Ruby codebases with no type annotations will need careful thought and testing during conversion to RBS, especially with dynamic constructs like `method_missing`.
- **Learning Curve:** While Ruby developers are used to a flexible and dynamically typed environment, RBS requires some effort to adopt and maintain.


## Conclusion
RBS introduces the possibility of **adding static typing** to Ruby without breaking its dynamic nature, providing both flexibility and reliability for developers. By integrating RBS with tools like Steep and Sorbet, Ruby developers can enjoy the benefits of improved tooling, better type safety, and cleaner codebases.

For those familiar with statically-typed languages, adopting Ruby RBS can offer a smoother transition, while still allowing Ruby's hallmark flexibility. Whether you are starting a new project or working with an existing one, Ruby RBS is an excellent way to increase productivity and reduce bugs with minimal hassle.

As Ruby 3 and later versions continue to develop, expect **Ruby RBS** to become an increasingly valuable tool for developers who appreciate static typing within a dynamic language.
